This is about the 'Slidy Puzzle' or '15 Puzzle' games

The one where there is a square grid of numbered tiles, with one empty tiles
You can slide the tiles about to attempt to put them in order, 1,2,3,4...

There is a computer program that allows people to play this, which automatically records the duration, movecount and other statistics

The plots are showing some of my games, the position of the cells show the frequency density at a varying move Communication
the colour represents the TPS, for Turns Per Second, or moves per second

People attempt to get good scores in multiple ways:
    fast times
    efficient use of moves (low move count)

they are seperate categories

See the dark region on the left of the plot? (particularly the 5x5 one)
This is where I was trying to be efficient to get a low move count,
    but this requires more thinking so the TPS is lower (hence the darkness in the region)


The plots are made in R
