
These plots are about minesweeper board generation

One shows the distribution of the '3BV' of a boards of a certain size
This is a value that depends on the ways the board is generated, lower 3BV makes a board faster to complete, so players care about this

The number of 'Openings' is also shown by colour, players also care about these since it affects gameplay
This was generated simply by simulating a large number of boards and recording the results



The other plots show the probability of the first click being each of the possible numbers or any given board size
This is calculated in Python and plotted in R
